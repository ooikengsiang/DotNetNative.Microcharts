# DotNetNative.Microcharts - An extremely simple charting library

Microcharts Library for .NET 7 / .NET 8 native iOS / Android / Mac.

*This is a quick / lazy port from Microcharts to support .NET 7 and .NET 8 since Xamarin is going away. If you are looking for MAUI support, this is not the one you are looking for.*

## About

This project is just simple drawing on top of the awesome [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) library. The purpose is not to have an heavily customizable charting library. If you want so, simply fork the code, since all of this is fairly simple. Their is no interaction, nor animation at the moment.
